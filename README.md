This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to enhance customer satisfaction and boost revenue. The process begins with thorough data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency, followed by an initial analysis to uncover patterns and insights. I also created visualizations to better understand the data, which were further enhanced in Tableau to provide more interactive and insightful business decision-making. The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights that can help optimize sales and improve the overall customer experience.

## **Key Insights & Conclusions 🧠**

1. **Discount Usage by Gender:**
   - Men use discounts more than women, with men using discounts 63.36% of the time, while women don’t use them at all.
   - **Recommendation**: Target women with special offers like bundled pricing or discount vouchers.
2. **Subscription and Discount Usage:**
   - Subscribers use discounts 100% of the time, while non-subscribers use them only 32.29% of the time.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement referral programs or exclusive discounts for subscribers to encourage loyalty.
3. **Importance of Segmentation:**
   - Segmenting customers by gender and subscription status helps create more targeted marketing strategies.
4. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - More analysis is needed on other factors affecting discount usage.
   - More data could lead to better insights, helping improve customer experience and business revenue.
